# twitter-sentiment-tracker

Core Use Case, Intent, and Business Purpose:
The primary purpose of my use of the X APIs is to collect and analyze public sentiment regarding specific stock tickers (such as $TSLA, $AAPL) as expressed on X (Twitter). The goal is to understand how public opinion on social media correlates with financial market trends. This project is for research and educational purposes, and is not connected to a commercial business.

Problem, User Story, and Overall Goal:
The problem addressed is the need for real-time, data-driven insights into how the public perceives companies and financial assets. The user story is: “As a researcher or investor, I want to see how people are talking about certain stocks on X, so I can better understand market sentiment and make more informed decisions.” The overall goal is to provide a dashboard and data pipeline that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes sentiment trends from X posts mentioning stock tickers.

Student/Learning Context:
I am a student/independent developer learning about data science, natural language processing, and financial analytics. This project is a practical application to build skills in API usage, data engineering, and sentiment analysis.

Analysis of Posts, Users, and Content:
I will collect posts (tweets) that mention specific stock tickers using the X API. The analysis will include:

Text cleaning and preprocessing.
Sentiment analysis using machine learning models to classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral.
Aggregation of sentiment scores over time and by ticker.
Visualization of sentiment trends and summary statistics. No analysis will be performed on user profiles beyond collecting the username for context; no personal or sensitive information will be stored or shared.
Interaction with X Content (Posting, Reposting, Liking):
My use case does not involve posting, reposting, or liking content. The project is read-only and only fetches public posts for analysis.

Display of X Content Off of X:
X content (tweet text, date, and username) will be displayed in a private dashboard and in CSV files for research and visualization purposes. Posts may be shown at the row level for inspection, but the primary display will be aggregated sentiment trends and summary statistics. All displays will comply with X’s Developer Policy, and no content will be made publicly available or redistributed.
